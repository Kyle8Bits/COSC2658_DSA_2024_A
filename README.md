### I. CONTRIBUTION INFORMATION

The starting score for each student is 5 points. Each group can decide to add/remove points to/from each member, but the total point of the whole group is kept unchanged (it is = (the number of members) * 5). Additional rules:

<ul>
    <li>The maximum point for a member is 7.
    <li>If a member gets zero points => that member gets zero for the whole group project assignment. In this case, the total point of the whole group = (the number of members whose scores > zero) * 5.
    <li>The contribution score must be agreed upon by all members. If there are disagreements, you must inform the lecturer/coordinator before the due time.
    <li>The maximum score for the whole project is 35. If you get more than 35 (due to a high contribution score), the final score is 35.
</ul>
